# takeabeltof

A package of utilities that are used in my [shotglass](https://github.com/wleddy/shotglass/) site-starter package.

(I moved these scripts out of their previous locations in shotglass and users to make it easier to keep them updated.)

You'll want to clone this into a new shotglass based project.

Some of the modules here include:

## database.py

This module provides access to the Sqlite3 database.
